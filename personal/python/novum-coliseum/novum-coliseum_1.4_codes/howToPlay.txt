 Welcome to Novum Coliseum.
 Novum Coliseum is an RPG terminal game, based on another 
much, much complex RPG game of the same name, made 
by a friend of mine. That's how it works:

 Novum Coliseum is a simple turn based RPG. The main three
actions you can choose is to run forward or backwards
and attack.

Players:
 Players have 30 HP in total, and will always start with a 
distance of 8 steps from each other. 

Running:
 In the beginning, the only two options for action
are running, forward or backwards. But keep in mind that
the maximum distance between players is 12 steps, and
the minimum is 1. 
 If player chooses to run, they throw two d4 dices, and
run an amount of steps according to the sum of the
dice values.

Attacking
 To be able to attack, the maximum distance required is 3 
steps from each other. Otherwise you will only be able to 
run. 
 When player attacks, they throw two d20 dices, and their 
Attack Point (AP) is defined by the maximum value gotten.
 Then, the opponent throws another two d20, getting their
Defense Points (DP), defined as well by their maximum
value in the dices.
 If the player gets a Critical Attack (20 AP), they will
roll three d8 dices, and will deal the damage according to 
the sum of all the values. Otherwise, if only the AP points
are greater than the DP, the player throws only two d8 and
deals damage according, as well, to the sum of the values.
 The opponent can get a Critical Defense (20 DP), and in 
that case, they will reflect the attack to the player. The 
reflection damage is inversely proportional to the opponent's 
HP. The minimum reflection rate, related to 30 HP, is 2 points
of damage, while the maximum, related to 1hp, is 20 points.

Game modes
 The game has two main game modes: Multiplayer, that let you
play with a friend, and Single Player, that let you play
with Novum Bot auto player.

That's all. Have fun! ;)
