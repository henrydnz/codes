# Hi, welcome!

This is my personal code repository! Here I organize my academic and personal programming projects. The goal of this repository is to showcase my continuous learning, coding practices, and growth as a developer.

## 🏫 Academic Projects (`academic/`)

This folder contains code developed throughout my academic journey. The projects are organized by year and subject.

## 🧪 Personal Projects (`personal/`)

Here you'll find projects I created on my own initiative. They include experiments with languages, algorithms, graphical interfaces, automations, or any other type of project that helps me learn and explore new ideas.
